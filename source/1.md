# Question 1

Upon running the program, Line 16 of the source never gets printed as the parent becomes a Zombie process.

You can verify the same by using the following commands:

```
./binaries/1 &
ps -l
```

Later you can kill the Zombie process by using

```
kill -9 {PID of the Zombie process}
```
