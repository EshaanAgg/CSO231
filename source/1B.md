# Question 1B

All the required functions of the API are implemented in the source file.

The main program first allocates `1000` PIDs to represent `1000` processes on our system, all the while storig the PID of the `4`th and `5`th alloted process. These PIDs are later released, along with a random PID `1000`, which may or may not have been assigned till then.

Multiple runs of the following command would give you different outputs each time:

```
./binaries/1B
```
